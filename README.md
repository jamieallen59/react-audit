# react-audit
placeholder

TODO

1. destructuring rule
- check for react/destructuring
- if there, run their linter?
- give summary of packages not found
- use chalk to display nice messaging
- if not there, ask to download the package

2. eslint
- Do initial checks for eslint
- If not there, ask to download?


IDEAS
- Set a reminder to come back after completing one rule?
- Create my own recommended eslint to use !?!?
- statically analyse for container/components?
- check for promises Vs sagas/observables
- check for split out endpoints file + api?
